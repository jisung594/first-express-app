    <p>A full-stack web developer, finding joy in utilizing his design background to breathe visual life into his code. My previous work experience as a graphic designer has proven to be beneficial in this transition; the mindset of prioritizing the user remains constant. I’ve been exercising skills in both frontend and backend technologies, such as React/Redux and Ruby on Rails, to create a synergy between form and function. Cheers to gardening, 90’s sitcoms, and existential philosophy.</p>
